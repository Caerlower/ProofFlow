# ProofFlow

**Verifiable, Pay-As-You-Go Storage Powered by Filecoin Onchain Cloud**

---

## 🌟 Overview

ProofFlow is a next-generation storage solution built on **Filecoin Onchain Cloud**, designed to bring the **utility model of cloud services** into the decentralized world.

With ProofFlow, users and developers can access **verifiable storage and retrieval** with **pay-as-you-go billing**, powered by:

* **FilecoinWarmStorageService** for fast, PDP-verified storage.
* **Filecoin Pay** for streaming & usage-based payments.
* **FilCDN** for blazing-fast retrieval.
* **Synapse SDK** for seamless developer integration.

This transforms Filecoin from a cold archival system into a **programmable, on-chain cloud** for real-world applications.

## 💡 Problem

Cloud storage today is dominated by centralized providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) with opaque pricing, vendor lock-in, and little verifiability.

In decentralized storage, existing Filecoin solutions:

* Require **bulk storage deals**, not flexible usage.
* Lack **streaming/metered payments** for end-users.
* Make **retrieval and UX** harder for consumer-facing apps.

This leaves a gap: **developers and businesses want Filecoin’s trustless storage, but with cloud-like flexibility, pricing, and reliability**.

## 🚀 Solution: ProofFlow

ProofFlow delivers:

1. **Pay-As-You-Go Storage**

   * Users pay only for the data they store/retrieve, billed via **Filecoin Pay** streaming payments.

2. **Verifiable Data Possession**

   * Integrated **PDP checks** ensure that storage providers are continuously proving they still hold your data.

3. **Blazing-Fast Retrieval**

   * **FilCDN integration** delivers cached, high-speed access for end-users.

4. **Developer-Friendly SDK**

   * Plug-and-play with the **Synapse SDK** — simple APIs for upload, retrieval, and payment flows.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User/App → ProofFlow SDK (Synapse) → FilecoinWarmStorageService + Filecoin Pay
                                   ↘ FilCDN (fast retrieval)
                                   ↘ PDP Verifier (integrity checks)
```

* **Synapse SDK**: simple interface for developers.
* **WarmStorage + PDP**: ensures fast storage and ongoing proofs.
* **Filecoin Pay**: streams payments as storage is consumed.
* **FilCDN**: enables smooth, low-latency retrieval.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

* **dApps & Games** → store user content with metered payments.
* **Media Platforms** → CDN-level speed for decentralized video streaming.
* **Enterprises** → verifiable data compliance + transparent pay-as-you-go billing.
* **IoT/DePIN apps** → devices can store sensor data with micro-payments.

## 📈 Unique Value (Why ProofFlow?)

* Unlike existing Filecoin solutions (e.g., Estuary, NFT.storage, etc.), ProofFlow is:
  ✅ **Pay-as-you-go** (not bulk, not flat pricing)
  ✅ **Streaming payments** (continuous settlement between users & providers)
  ✅ **Cloud-like UX** (FilCDN retrieval + SDK ease)
  ✅ **Enterprise-ready** (verifiable proofs + transparent billing)

## 📢 Feedback to Filecoin Onchain Cloud

As we build ProofFlow, we will provide feedback on:

* **Payment granularity** → support for smaller, micro-metering units.
* **SDK DX** → simplifying developer integration (examples, docs).
* **FilCDN optimization** → retrieval SLAs and caching behaviors.
